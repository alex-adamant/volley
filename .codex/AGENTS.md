# Local instructions

- Run `npm run -w @volley/ui lint` before reporting UI changes.
- Run `npm run -w @volley/ui check` to catch Svelte/TypeScript issues.
- use dash-case (e.g. trigger-group.svelte) for component names.
- Always use the latest svelte syntax.
- In tailwind use as much shortcuts as possible. Like size-4 instead of w-4 h-4; p-4 instead of px-4 py-4. 
- Don't use sizes like text-[0.6rem], use native tailwind sizes. As for specific values - just put them to the tailwind config.
